# Internship Code Collection



This repository contains all the scripts I developed during my internship. It includes three main Python tools:

1. Italian Province Extractor (`italian_province_extractor.py`)  
   Downloads PDFs from Airtable records, identifies Italian provinces mentioned using GPT-4, and writes them back in `(XX) Province Name` format.

2. Business Contact Finder (`business_finder.py`)  
   Searches for hotels, restaurants, bars, cafés, etc., using Google Places, Yelp Fusion or OpenStreetMap APIs; extracts phone, website and email contacts; and saves results to a CSV file.

3. De Minimis Checker (`detect_deminimis.py`)  
   Scans PDF text for the phrase “de minimis” (handling negations) and updates a “Deminimis” checkbox field in Airtable.
