This repository contains a set of demonstration projects I developed during my internship.  
Each folder includes a separate project involving Python scripting, automation, AI classification, and API integration.


## üìÅ Projects

### 1. [Business Contact Finder](./business_finder)  
- Search and collect business contact data (hotels, restaurants, etc.) using multiple APIs (Google Places, Yelp Fusion, OpenStreetMap).  
- Automatically extracts emails from websites and exports filtered results to CSV.

### 2. [De Minimis Clause Detector](./detect_deminimis)  
- Scan PDF documents attached to Airtable records for presence of ‚ÄúDe Minimis‚Äù clause.  
- Uses Italian NLP (spaCy) to detect the phrase and update a checkbox field in Airtable.

### 3. [Province Extractor](./italian-province-extractor)  
- Extract province names from Italian public funding documents (bandi) using OpenAI GPT-4o.  
- Supports OCR fallback for scanned PDFs and rule-based parsing to improve LLM input quality.  
- Results are written back to Airtable using standardized format (e.g., `(TO) Torino`).
